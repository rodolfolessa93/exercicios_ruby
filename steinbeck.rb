puts "And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable 
thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, 
undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual.
This is what I am and what I am about"
